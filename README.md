# ODM / PDFBox integration
This sample shows a simple integration of the [Apache PDFBox](https://pdfbox.apache.org/) API with ODM in order to apply rules on PDF interactive forms (AcroForms).

The example is showing how to apply some fictitious validation rules on a Form 1040 (U.S. Individual Income Tax Return) document.
A quick intro to the example is provided in [this deck](https://github.com/pberlandier/odm-with-pdfbox/blob/master/docs/Decisions%20with%20ODM%20and%20PDF%20Forms.pptx).
